**1. Clustering** \
[Sort Note on Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) \
Type of Clustering Algorithms:
- Connectivity models: for example, hierarchical clustering builds models based on distance connectivity.
- Centroid models: for example, the k-means algorithm represents each cluster by a single mean vector.
- Distribution models: clusters are modeled using statistical distributions, such as multivariate normal distributions used by the expectation-maximization algorithm.
- Density models: for example, DBSCAN and OPTICS defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.
- Subspace models: in biclustering (also known as co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes.
- Group models: some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information.
- Graph-based models: a clique, that is, a subset of nodes in a graph such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster. Relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement (a fraction of the edges can be missing) are known as quasi-cliques, as in the HCS clustering algorithm.
- Signed graph models: Every path in a signed graph has a sign from the product of the signs on the edges. Under the assumptions of balance theory, edges may change sign and result in a bifurcated graph. The weaker "clusterability axiom" (no cycle has exactly one negative edge) yields results with more than two clusters, or subgraphs with only positive edges.[6]
- Neural models: the most well known unsupervised neural network is the self-organizing map and these models can usually be characterized as similar to one or more of the above models, and including subspace models when neural networks implement a form of Principal Component Analysis or Independent Component Analysis. 
  
There are many clustering algorithms. In fact, there are more than 100 clustering algorithms that have been published so far. However, despite the various types of clustering algorithms, they can generally be categorised into four methods. Let‚Äôs look at these briefly: \
